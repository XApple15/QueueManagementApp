  Queue Management Application with a user-friendly interface that simulates the behavior of clients in multiple queues, utilizing MULTITHREADING for realistic and efficient queue management. Users will be able to input key parameters such as:
  
-the number of queues.

-maximum simulation time.

-number of clients.

-minimum and maximum arrival time for each client.

-minimum and maximum processing time for each client.
  
  The application will automatically manage the clients using two strategies: Shortest Queue and Shortest Line.
  
  The interface will display the queues in real-time, allowing users to observe the simulation as it progresses. After the simulation ends, the application will present detailed statistics about the queues, such as average wait time, average service time, and peak hour.

  This project aims to provide a practical, visual, and interactive approach to understanding queue management and optimization strategies.
